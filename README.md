LiMSpec
=======

LiMSpec is intended to ultimately serve as a complete tool for managing the evaluation process for LIMS/LIS selection. Initially, it is focused on cataloguing requirements and vendor questions, and allowing for the categorization and assignment to specific industries. Users can create their own private collection of requirements and questions, and export in a variety of formats â€“ including Open Office Document format (which MS Word handles just fine).
